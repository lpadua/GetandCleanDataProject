As stated on the original dataset, the experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

On this work, we are extracting, from the original dataset, the average of all channels that are mean and standard deviation of the observations from the merged Test and Training datasets. Which contains:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 

These averages are from the combination of subject who performed and the type of activity. Resulting in 180 observations from 30 volunteers and the 6 activities.
